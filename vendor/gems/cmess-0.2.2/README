= cmess - Assist with handling messed up encodings

== VERSION

This documentation refers to cmess version 0.2.2


== DESCRIPTION

CMess bundles several tools under its hood that aim at dealing with various
problems occurring in the context of character sets and encodings. Currently,
there are:

guess_encoding::  Simple helper to identify the encoding of a given string.
                  Includes the ability to automatically detect the encoding
                  of an input.
cinderella::      When characters are "double encoded", you can't easily
                  convert them back -- this is where cinderella comes in,
                  sorting the good ones into the pot and the (potentially)
                  bad ones into the crop...
bconv::           Convert between bibliographic (and other) encodings.
decode_entities:: Decode HTML entities in a string.

TODO: well, more of the description... ;-)
